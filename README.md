##  ðŸ‘‹ Hi there
Iâ€™m **Ahmed Kamal**, a software engineering student at ALX from Alexandria, Egypt.
## ðŸŒ± About me
Iâ€™m a software engineering student at ALX who is interested in backend development.
Iâ€™m passionate about solving problems with code and learning new technologies.
Iâ€™m currently learning Python, C, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and more advanced topics such as data structures, algorithms, system engineering,
devops, low-level programming, and Linux. 
Iâ€™m also interested in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and blockchain.
## :file_cabinet: Projects
Some of the projects that I have worked on or are currently working on are:
- [ALX Low-Level Programming](https://github.com/ahmedmkamal313/alx-low_level_programming): A series of projects that cover the basics of C programming, such as variables, data types, operators, loops, functions, pointers, arrays, and more.
- [ALX Higher-Level Programming](https://github.com/ahmedmkamal313/alx-higher_level_programming): A series of projects that cover the basics of Python programming, such as data structures, modules, exceptions, classes, inheritance, and more.
- [ALX System Engineering & DevOps](https://github.com/ahmedmkamal313/alx-system_engineering-devops): A series of projects that cover the basics of Linux system administration, such as shell commands, scripts, permissions, networking, web servers, and more.
- [printf](https://github.com/ahmedmkamal313/printf): A project that recreates the functionality of the printf function in C. It handles various format specifiers and flags to print different data types to the standard output.
- [Simple Shell](https://github.com/ahmedmkamal313/simple_shell): A project that creates a simple UNIX command interpreter. It handles basic commands, built-ins, environment variables, and redirections.
- [Monty](https://github.com/ahmedmkamal313/monty): A project that interprets Monty ByteCodes files. It implements a stack data structure and various operations on it. It also handles errors and edge cases.
- [sorting_algorithms](https://github.com/ahmedmkamal313/sorting_algorithms): This project is a group assignment for ALX SE, where we implement four different sorting algorithms in C and analyze their time complexity using Big O notation.
